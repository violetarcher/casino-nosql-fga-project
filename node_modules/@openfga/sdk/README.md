## About

[OpenFGA](https://openfga.dev) is an open source Fine-Grained Authorization solution inspired by [Google's Zanzibar paper](https://research.google/pubs/pub48190/). It was created by the FGA team at [Auth0](https://auth0.com) based on [Auth0 Fine-Grained Authorization (FGA)](https://fga.dev), available under [a permissive license (Apache-2)](https://github.com/openfga/rfcs/blob/main/LICENSE) and welcomes community contributions.

OpenFGA is designed to make it easy for application builders to model their permission layer, and to add and integrate fine-grained authorization into their applications. OpenFGAâ€™s design is optimized for reliability and low latency at a high scale.

## Getting Started

### Initializing the API Client

[Learn how to initialize your SDK](https://openfga.dev/docs/getting-started/setup-sdk-client)

We strongly recommend you initialize the `OpenFgaClient` only once and then re-use it throughout your app, otherwise you will incur the cost of having to re-initialize multiple times or at every request, the cost of reduced connection pooling and re-use, and would be particularly costly in the client credentials flow, as that flow will be preformed on every request.

> The `OpenFgaClient` will by default retry API requests up to 15 times on 429 and 5xx errors.

#### No Credentials

```javascript
const { OpenFgaClient } = require('@openfga/sdk'); // OR import { OpenFgaClient } from '@openfga/sdk';

const fgaClient = new OpenFgaClient({
  apiUrl: process.env.FGA_API_URL, // required
  storeId: process.env.FGA_STORE_ID, // not needed when calling `CreateStore` or `ListStores`
  authorizationModelId: process.env.FGA_AUTHORIZATION_MODEL_ID, // Optional, can be overridden per request
});
```

#### API Token

```javascript
const { OpenFgaClient } = require('@openfga/sdk'); // OR import { OpenFgaClient } from '@openfga/sdk';

const fgaClient = new OpenFgaClient({
  apiUrl: process.env.FGA_API_URL, // required
  storeId: process.env.FGA_STORE_ID, // not needed when calling `CreateStore` or `ListStores`
  authorizationModelId: process.env.FGA_AUTHORIZATION_MODEL_ID, // Optional, can be overridden per request
  credentials: {
    method: CredentialsMethod.ApiToken,
    config: {
      token: process.env.FGA_API_TOKEN, // will be passed as the "Authorization: Bearer ${ApiToken}" request header
    }
  }
});
```

#### Client Credentials

```javascript
const { OpenFgaClient } = require('@openfga/sdk'); // OR import { OpenFgaClient } from '@openfga/sdk';

const fgaClient = new OpenFgaClient({
  apiUrl: process.env.FGA_API_URL, // required
  storeId: process.env.FGA_STORE_ID, // not needed when calling `CreateStore` or `ListStores`
  authorizationModelId: process.env.FGA_AUTHORIZATION_MODEL_ID, // Optional, can be overridden per request
  credentials: {
    method: CredentialsMethod.ClientCredentials,
    config: {
      apiTokenIssuer: process.env.FGA_API_TOKEN_ISSUER,
      apiAudience: process.env.FGA_API_AUDIENCE,
      clientId: process.env.FGA_CLIENT_ID,
      clientSecret: process.env.FGA_CLIENT_SECRET,
    }
  }
});
```


### Get your Store ID

You need your store id to call the OpenFGA API (unless it is to call the [CreateStore](#create-store) or [ListStores](#list-stores) methods).

If your server is configured with [authentication enabled](https://openfga.dev/docs/getting-started/setup-openfga#configuring-authentication), you also need to have your credentials ready.

### Calling the API

> Note regarding casing in the OpenFgaClient:
> All input parameters are in `camelCase`, all response parameters will match the API and are in `snake_case`.

> Note: The Client interface might see several changes over the next few months as we get more feedback before it stabilizes.

#### Stores

##### List Stores

Get a paginated list of stores.

[API Documentation](https://openfga.dev/api/service#/Stores/ListStores)

```javascript
const options = { pageSize: 10, continuationToken: "..." };

// stores = [{ "id": "01FQH7V8BEG3GPQW93KTRFR8JB", "name": "FGA Demo Store", "created_at": "2022-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "updated_at": "2022-01-01T00:00:00.000Z" }]
```

##### Create Store

[API Documentation](https://openfga.dev/api/service#/Authorization%20Models/ReadAuthorizationModels)

>  Requires a client initialized with a storeId

```javascript
const options = { pageSize: 10, continuationToken: "..." };

const { authorization_models: authorizationModels } = await fgaClient.readAuthorizationModels(options);

/*
authorizationModels = [
 { id: "01GXSA8YR785C4FYS3C0RTG7B1", schema_version: "1.1", type_definitions: [...] },
 { id: "01GXSBM5PVYHCJNRNKXMB4QZTW", schema_version: "1.1", type_definitions: [...] }];
*/
```

##### Write Authorization Model

Create a new authorization model.

[API Documentation](https://openfga.dev/api/service#/Authorization%20Models/WriteAuthorizationModel)

> Note: To learn how to build your authorization model, check the Docs at https://openfga.dev/docs.

> Learn more about [the OpenFGA configuration language](https://openfga.dev/docs/configuration-language).

> You can use the [OpenFGA Syntax Transformer](https://github.com/openfga/syntax-transformer) to convert between the friendly DSL and the JSON authorization model.

```javascript
const { authorization_model_id: id } = await fgaClient.writeAuthorizationModel({
  schema_version: "1.1",
  type_definitions: [{
      type: "user",
    }, {
    type: "document",
    relations: {
      "writer": { "this": {} },
      "viewer": {
        "union": {
          "child": [
            { "this": {} },
            { "computedUserset": {
               "object": "",
              "relation": "writer" }
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    } }],
});

// id = "01GXSA8YR785C4FYS3C0RTG7B1"
```

##### Read a Single Authorization Model

Read a particular authorization model.

```javascript
const options = {};

// To override the authorization model id for this request
options.authorizationModelId = "01GXSA8YR785C4FYS3C0RTG7B1";

const { authorization_model: authorizationModel } = await fgaClient.readAuthorizationModel(options);

// authorizationModel = { id: "01GXSA8YR785C4FYS3C0RTG7B1", schema_version: "1.1", type_definitions: [...] }
```

##### Read the Latest Authorization Model

Reads the latest authorization model (note: this ignores the model id in configuration).

[API Documentation](https://openfga.dev/api/service#/Authorization%20Models/ReadAuthorizationModel)

```javascript
const { authorization_model: authorizationModel } = await fgaClient.readLatestAuthorizationModel();

// authorizationModel = { id: "01GXSA8YR785C4FYS3C0RTG7B1", schema_version: "1.1", type_definitions: [...] }
```

#### Relationship Tuples

##### Read Relationship Tuple Changes (Watch)

Reads the list of historical relationship tuple writes and deletes.

[API Documentation](https://openfga.dev/api/service#/Relationship%20Tuples/ReadChanges)

```javascript
const type = 'document';
const options = {
  pageSize: 25,
  continuationToken: 'eyJwayI6IkxBVEVTVF9OU0NPTkZJR19hdXRoMHN0b3JlIiwic2siOiIxem1qbXF3MWZLZExTcUoyN01MdTdqTjh0cWgifQ==',
};

const response = await fgaClient.readChanges({ type }, options);

// response.continuation_token = ...
// response.changes = [
//   { tuple_key: { user, relation, object }, operation: "writer", timestamp: ... },
//   { tuple_key: { user, relation, object }, operation: "viewer", timestamp: ... }
// ]
```

##### Read Relationship Tuples

Reads the relationship tuples stored in the database. It does not evaluate nor exclude invalid tuples according to the authorization model.

[API Documentation](https://openfga.dev/api/service#/Relationship%20Tuples/Read)

```javascript
// Find if a relationship tuple stating that a certain user is a viewer of a certain document
const body = {
  user: "user:81684243-9356-4421-8fbf-a4f8d36aa31b",
  relation: "viewer",
  object: "document:roadmap",
};

// Find all relationship tuples where a certain user has any relation to a certain document
const body = {
  user: "user:81684243-9356-4421-8fbf-a4f8d36aa31b",
  object: "document:roadmap",
};

// Find all relationship tuples where a certain user is a viewer of any document
const body = {
  user: "user:81684243-9356-4421-8fbf-a4f8d36aa31b",
  relation: "viewer",
  object: "document:",
};

// Find all relationship tuples where a certain user has any relation with any document
const body = {
  user: "user:81684243-9356-4421-8fbf-a4f8d36aa31b",
  object: "document:",
};

// Find all relationship tuples where any user has any relation with a particular document
const body = {
  object: "document:roadmap",
};

// Read all stored relationship tuples
const body = {};

const { tuples } = await fgaClient.read(body);

// In all the above situations, the response will be of the form:
// tuples = [{ key: { user, relation, object }, timestamp: ... }]
```

##### Write (Create and Delete) Relationship Tuples

Create and/or delete relationship tuples to update the system state.

[API Documentation](https://openfga.dev/api/service#/Relationship%20Tuples/Write)

###### Transaction mode (default)

By default, write runs in a transaction mode where any invalid operation (deleting a non-existing tuple, creating an existing tuple, one of the tuples was invalid) or a server error will fail the entire operation.

```javascript
const options = {};

// To override the authorization model id for this request
options.authorizationModelId = "01GXSA8YR785C4FYS3C0RTG7B1";

await fgaClient.write({
  writes: [{ user: "user:81684243-9356-4421-8fbf-a4f8d36aa31b", relation: "viewer", object: "document:roadmap" }],
  deletes: [{ user: "user:81684243-9356-4421-8fbf-a4f8d36aa31b", relation: "editor", object: "document:roadmap" }],
}, options);

// Convenience functions are available
await fgaClient.writeTuples([{ user: "user:81684243-9356-4421-8fbf-a4f8d36aa31b", relation: "viewer", object: "document:roadmap" }], options);
await fgaClient.deleteTuples([{ user: "user:81684243-9356-4421-8fbf-a4f8d36aa31b", relation: "editor", object: "document:roadmap" }], options);

// if any error is encountered in the transaction mode, an error will be thrown
```

###### Non-transaction mode

The SDK will split the writes into separate requests and send them in parallel chunks (default = 1 item per chunk, each chunk is a transaction).

```
// if you'd like to disable the transaction mode for writes (requests will be sent in parallel writes)
options.transaction = {
  disable: true,
  maxPerChunk: 1, // defaults to 1 - each chunk is a transaction (even in non-transaction mode)
  maxParallelRequests: 10, // max requests to issue in parallel
};

const response = await fgaClient.write({
  writes: [{ user: "user:81684243-9356-4421-8fbf-a4f8d36aa31b", relation: "viewer", object: "document:roadmap" }],
  deletes: [{ user: "user:81684243-9356-4421-8fbf-a4f8d36aa31b", relation: "editor", object: "document:roadmap" }],
}, options);

/*
response = {
  writes: [{ tuple_key: { user: "user:81684243-9356-4421-8fbf-a4f8d36aa31b", relation: "viewer", object: "document:roadmap", status: "success" } }],
  deletes: [{ tuple_key: { user: "user:81684243-9356-4421-8fbf-a4f8d36aa31b", relation: "editor", object: "document:roadmap", status: "failure", err: <FgaError ...>  } }],
};
*/
```

#### Relationship Queries

##### Check

Check if a user has a particular relation with an object.

[API Documentation](https://openfga.dev/api/service#/Relationship%20Queries/Check)

```javascript
const options = {
  // if you'd like to override the authorization model id for this request
  authorizationModelId: "01GXSA8YR785C4FYS3C0RTG7B1",
};

const result = await fgaClient.check({
  user: "user:81684243-9356-4421-8fbf-a4f8d36aa31b",
  relation: "viewer",
  object: "document:roadmap",
}, options);

// result = { allowed: true }
```

##### Batch Check

Run a set of [checks](#check). Batch Check will return `allowed: false` if it encounters an error, and will return the error in the body.
If 429s or 5xxs are encountered, the underlying check will retry up to 15 times before giving up.

```javascript
const options = {
  // if you'd like to override the authorization model id for this request
  authorizationModelId: "01GXSA8YR785C4FYS3C0RTG7B1",
}
const { responses } = await fgaClient.batchCheck([{
  user: "user:81684243-9356-4421-8fbf-a4f8d36aa31b",
  relation: "viewer",
  object: "document:budget",
}, {
  user: "user:81684243-9356-4421-8fbf-a4f8d36aa31b",
  relation: "member",
  object: "document:budget",
}, {
  user: "user:81684243-9356-4421-8fbf-a4f8d36aa31b",
  relation: "viewer",
  object: "document:roadmap",
  contextual_tuples: [{
    user: "user:81684243-9356-4421-8fbf-a4f8d36aa31b",
    relation: "writer",
    object: "document:roadmap"
  }],
}], options);

/*
responses = [{
  allowed: false,
  _request: {
    user: "user:81684243-9356-4421-8fbf-a4f8d36aa31b",
    relation: "viewer",
    object: "document:budget",
  }
}, {
  allowed: false,
  _request: {
    user: "user:81684243-9356-4421-8fbf-a4f8d36aa31b",
    relation: "member",
    object: "document:budget",
  },
  err: <FgaError ...>
}, {
  allowed: true,
  _request: {
    user: "user:81684243-9356-4421-8fbf-a4f8d36aa31b",
    relation: "viewer",
    object: "document:roadmap",
    contextual_tuples: [{
      user: "user:81684243-9356-4421-8fbf-a4f8d36aa31b",
      relation: "writer",
      object: "document:roadmap"
    }],
  }},
]
*/
```

#### Expand

Expands the relationships in userset tree format.

[API Documentation](https://openfga.dev/api/service#/Relationship%20Queries/Expand)

```javascript
const options = {};

// To override the authorization model id for this request
options.authorizationModelId = "01GXSA8YR785C4FYS3C0RTG7B1";

const { tree } = await fgaClient.expand({
  relation: "viewer",
  object: "document:roadmap",
}, options);

// tree  = { root: { name: "document:roadmap#viewer", leaf: { users: { users: ["user:81684243-9356-4421-8fbf-a4f8d36aa31b", "user:f52a4f7a-054d-47ff-bb6e-3ac81269988f"] } } } }
```

##### List Objects

 List the objects of a particular type that the user has a certain relation to.

[API Documentation](https://openfga.dev/api/service#/Relationship%20Queries/ListObjects)

```javascript
const options = {};

// To override the authorization model id for this request
options.authorizationModelId = "01GXSA8YR785C4FYS3C0RTG7B1";

const response = await fgaClient.listObjects({
  user: "user:81684243-9356-4421-8fbf-a4f8d36aa31b",
  relation: "viewer",
  type: "document",
  contextual_tuples: [{
    user: "user:81684243-9356-4421-8fbf-a4f8d36aa31b",
    relation: "writer",
    object: "document:budget"
  }],
}, options);

// response.objects = ["document:roadmap"]
```

##### List Relations

List the relations a user has with an object. This wraps around [BatchCheck](#batchcheck) to allow checking multiple relationships at once.

Note: Any error encountered when checking any relation will be treated as `allowed: false`;

```javascript
const options = {};

// To override the authorization model id for this request
options.authorization_model_id = "1uHxCSuTP0VKPYSnkq1pbb1jeZw";

const response = await fgaClient.listRelations({
  user: "user:81684243-9356-4421-8fbf-a4f8d36aa31b",
  object: "document:roadmap",
  relations: ["can_view", "can_edit", "can_delete"],
  contextual_tuples: [{
    user: "user:81684243-9356-4421-8fbf-a4f8d36aa31b",
    relation: "writer",
    object: "document:roadmap"
  }],
}, options);

// response.relations = ["can_view", "can_edit"]
```

response.assertions = [{
  user: "user:81684243-9356-4421-8fbf-a4f8d36aa31b",
  relation: "viewer",
  object: "document:roadmap",
  expectation: true,
}];
*/
```

##### Write Assertions
